Use classes

one class for game board (read in from file)
need method to see if a space is occupied or not

search strategy (successor function)

Simulation class to run the whole thing

The first line in the file creates a 2D array of that size

Robot can't move diagonally, only up-down-left-right

For ex:

. empty space (traversable)
i initial space (traversable, robot starts here)
g goal space (traversable, robot’s goal here)
+ obstacle (not traversable)

5
...g.
.++..
.i+..
..+..
+...+

The maps that you will generate as output should be the same as the maps in the input files, except
that each step in the path taken will be represented as an ‘o’ (the lower case letter o). The goal and
initial spaces should remain ‘g’ and ‘i’ respectively. As an example, a solution map to the above
input map might be:
ooog.
o++..
oi+..
..+..
+...+


Class list:

GameBoard Class - Generates the game board via reading a file
Simulation Class - main class that connects everything and runs search
Euclidean Class -  Euclidean distance from N to the goal
Manhattan Class - Manhattan distance to the goal
aStar Euclidean Class - Euclidean distance from N to the goal
aStar Manhattan Class - Manhattan distance to the goal

Strategy:
1. The program will ask the user for the name of the file and will take in the file name as input
2. When the user inputs the file, the board will be printed to the console to give the user a visual representation (look into graphics maybe?)
3.


with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
  while True:
      c = f.read(1)
      if not c: break
      print c
